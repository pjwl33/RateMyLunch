####A fun and innovative game for Employees to inspire co-workers to eat the best lunches for their goals

You choose a health goal, based on preset paths: "Lose Weight", "Eat more Veggies", "More Protein", "Less Sodium", etc.

You can anonymously rate your co-workers' meals based on their goals and what they ate throughout the week. Meals display a picture, nutrition facts, goal category, and comments.

Your personal ratings will allow you to influence how your employer caters for meals

Companies can see best rated meals from their employees and what their employees are consuming for their healthier goals
