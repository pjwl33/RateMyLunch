You can anonymously rate your co-workers' meals based on their goals and what they ate throughout the week. Meals display a picture, nutrition facts, goal category, and comments.

Your personal ratings will allow you to influence how your employer caters for meals

Companies can see best rated meals from their employees and what their employees are consuming for their healthier goals
